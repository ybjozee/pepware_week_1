# Project Background
It's finally Monday!  Your very first Weekly Project!  So here it is:

You're working with an accountant named Arthur.

Arthur has a client, Matilda.  Matilda is 68 years old and sells cupcakes.  Matilda is not a big fan of spreadsheets, accounting software, or computers in general really.

Every so often Matilda sends Arthur three files:

Basic.txt, Delux.txt, and Total.txt
(Download examples here)

Naturally, as any savvy business owner, Matilda wants to understand her business.  So she sends Arthur those files and wants to know: "How much money did I make last year? How much money do I make in a typical month?  Can you help, please? I do need your help,  I'm very busy baking cupcakes, and my arthritis flares up when I spend a whole day on the calculator."

To be totally honest, Arthur is not Matilda's biggest fan right now.  Arthur is glad he finally got her to type up this info and email it instead of faxing it, but she flat out won't do anything more complicated than this.

It could be worse, Matilda is a woman of routine:
These documents never have dates, each line was entered on a different day.  The bottom-most row is always 'Today', the row above that is 'Yesterday', and so on.
The files are always lined up perfectly, you never have to worry about them being 'out of sync' or anything like that.
Basic.txt is the number of basic cupcakes she sold on that day, and they cost $5.  
Deluxe.txt is the number of Deluxe cupcakes (they have sprinkles!) sold on that day, and they cost $6.  
Total.txt is the total money she made (let's not even think about taxes yet, ugh).
Matilda every so often wants to know:
Yearly Revenue Totals
Monthly Revenue Totals
Weekly Revenue Totals
I'll bet that this week you can code something up that will take these text files in and spit those answers out, whenever she asks.

If you want to get fancy, here's how you might take it even further:
Break these stats down by item.
Generate a graph of the data, Matilda loves charts
Get creative with the input.  Maybe you can think of something she'll actually use.

## Installation

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
